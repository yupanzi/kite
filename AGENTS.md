# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project nature

Kite is a single-binary Kubernetes web console with a Go backend and a React
frontend. The backend serves API routes, embeds the built frontend from
`static/`, manages users/RBAC/settings through GORM, and talks to Kubernetes
clusters through controller-runtime/client-go clients. The frontend is a Vite
React app that renders resource lists, detail pages, settings, terminals, Helm
views, metrics, global search, and the AI chat UI.

Keep changes narrow. Do not add tests, refactors, helpers, feature flags, broad
validation, compatibility shims, comments, or docs unless the current task
requires them. If a change is local to one handler or component, keep it there.

## Build

The root `Makefile` is the main command surface.

```bash
make deps       # pnpm install in ui/ and go mod download
make frontend   # build ui/ into static/
make backend    # build the Go binary
make build      # frontend + backend
make dev        # run Go backend and Vite dev server
make lint       # go vet, golangci-lint, frontend eslint
make format     # go fmt and frontend prettier
make type-check # frontend tsc -b --noEmit
make pre-commit # required before committing
```

Frontend type errors only surface under `tsc -b` (build mode), because
`ui/tsconfig.json` is a references-only solution file that checks nothing on its
own. Keep `type-check` on `tsc -b` and keep it in `pre-commit`.

Backend-only checks can be run directly:

```bash
go test ./...
go test ./pkg/resources
go test ./pkg/cluster
```

Frontend commands live in `ui/`:

```bash
pnpm --dir ui run build
pnpm --dir ui run type-check
pnpm --dir ui run lint
pnpm --dir ui run test
```

End-to-end tests live in `e2e/` and use Playwright plus a local kind cluster:

```bash
make e2e-test
make e2e-run SPEC=specs/cluster-management.spec.ts
```

Run only the checks relevant to the files you changed unless the user asks for a
larger sweep. Before creating a commit, always run `make pre-commit` and use its
result as the commit gate.

## Architecture

Process startup is split across the root Go files:

- `main.go` handles flags, pprof on localhost, HTTP server startup, shutdown,
  and build-version logging.
- `app.go` loads environment settings, initializes DB, RBAC, templates, config
  file/env input, the cluster manager, config watcher, scheduler, and Gin
  middleware.
- `routes.go` registers public, auth, admin, protected, resource, Helm,
  terminal, metrics, proxy, and AI routes.
- `static.go` embeds `static/`, serves hashed assets with cache middleware, and
  falls back to `static/index.html` for frontend routes.

The backend package layout is feature-oriented:

- `pkg/model` is the GORM layer. `InitDB` auto-migrates all models and supports
  sqlite, mysql, and postgres. Sensitive persisted strings use `SecretString`.
- `pkg/cluster` owns `ClusterManager`, Kubernetes client creation, Prometheus
  discovery, and cluster sync.
- `pkg/kube` wraps controller-runtime/client-go clients and owns the shared
  runtime scheme.
- `pkg/resources` owns Kubernetes resource APIs. Most resources use
  `GenericResourceHandler`; version-dependent APIs use
  `versionedResourceHandler`; CRDs use `CRHandler`.
- `pkg/common/resource.go` is the backend resource registry for kinds, aliases,
  scope, searchability, and related-resource support.
- `pkg/rbac` checks Kite RBAC roles before resource access.
- `pkg/auth`, `pkg/users`, and `pkg/apikeys` own login, OAuth/LDAP/password
  users, cookies, API keys, and admin gates.
- `pkg/helm` and `pkg/helmutil` own chart repositories, chart content, and Helm
  release actions.
- `pkg/terminal`, `pkg/kube`, and `pkg/resources/logs_handler.go` own websocket
  terminals, exec, and log streaming.
- `pkg/ai` owns provider configuration, chat handling, tool definitions,
  interaction pauses, Kubernetes tool execution, and tool authorization.

### AI request budgets

Two settings control model behaviour and they are not interchangeable:

- `AIMaxTokens` is a per-response ceiling. On current Claude models thinking and
  answer text share it, so a small value truncates the answer. It is sent to the
  provider as configured — never clamped, floored, or rejected, because only the
  provider knows the configured model's real limit.
- `AIEffort` (`output_config.effort`) is the reasoning-depth knob and the only
  one: `budget_tokens` is removed on current models and returns 400. Levels are
  `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, default `xhigh`. Anthropic path only.

`anthropicModelSupportsModernFeatures` gates effort, adaptive thinking, and
context management behind a deny list of model-name substrings. That list tracks
*request-surface support*, not lifecycle — Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5
are all still sold but reject the modern surface, and retired first-party models
stay listed because they remain available through Bedrock and Google Cloud. A
false negative here silently downgrades a capable model; there is no retry on a
400, so widening the gate needs a fallback path first.

SSE streams (`newStreamSender` in `pkg/ai/handler.go`) emit a keepalive comment
every 20s. An agent turn is legitimately silent while a tool runs, and
ingress-nginx closes a connection after 60s of backend silence. Chart timeouts
and the ingress annotation examples in `charts/kite/values.yaml` are the other
half of this — change them together.

## Request flow

Most protected API calls go through:

1. `authHandler.RequireAuth()`
2. `middleware.ClusterMiddleware(cm)`
3. feature-specific handlers
4. `middleware.RBACMiddleware()` before registered Kubernetes resource routes

The current cluster is passed as `x-cluster-name`. The frontend writes it to
localStorage and a cookie in `ui/src/lib/current-cluster.ts`, and the API client
adds the encoded header in `ui/src/lib/api-client.ts`. The backend middleware
also accepts the same value from query params or cookies for websocket and other
non-fetch flows.

## Frontend

Frontend entry points:

- `ui/src/main.tsx` wires top-level providers.
- `ui/src/App.tsx` owns the app shell, cluster gate, search, terminal, and AI
  chat surfaces.
- `ui/src/routes.tsx` owns routing.
- `ui/src/lib/api/` owns API functions, re-exported by `ui/src/lib/api.ts`.

UI rules:

- Keep UI simple and consistent with existing visual and interaction patterns.
- Reuse existing components before creating new ones.
- Treat `ui/src/components/ui` as shadcn-managed primitives; edit them only when
  the primitive itself must change.
- Put reusable feature-level components under `ui/src/components`.

When adding or renaming a resource surface, keep these in sync:

- backend constants and registry in `pkg/common/resource.go`
- backend handler registration in `pkg/resources/handler.go`
- frontend resource catalog in `ui/src/lib/resource-catalog.ts`
- route/page/component files under `ui/src/pages` and `ui/src/components`
- translation keys in `ui/src/i18n/locales/en.json` and `zh.json`

Frontend formatting is Prettier-driven: no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space
indentation, sorted imports. Let the configured formatter handle import order.

## Configuration and deployment

Runtime settings are loaded in `pkg/common/common.go` from environment variables
such as `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `KITE_ENCRYPT_KEY`, `DB_TYPE`, `DB_DSN`,
`KITE_BASE`, `KITE_CONFIG_FILE`, and CORS settings.

External config files are parsed in `internal/config.go`. File-managed sections
(`clusters`, `oauth`, `ldap`, `rbac`, `superUser`) become read-only in the UI.
The config watcher reloads managed sections at runtime.

The Helm chart lives under `charts/kite`. Chart templates wire environment,
secrets, sqlite persistence, config file mounts, service account/RBAC, ingress,
gateway, probes, and deployment strategy. If changing runtime env behavior,
check both `pkg/common/common.go` and the chart template/value path that sets
the same variable.

## Do not edit generated outputs

Do not edit these files by hand:

- `static/`: generated by `pnpm --dir ui run build` or `make frontend`
- `kite` and `bin/`: generated binaries
- `ui/node_modules/`, `e2e/node_modules/`, and Vite cache directories

Only update lockfiles (`go.sum`, `ui/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `e2e/pnpm-lock.yaml`) when
dependency changes require it.

## Coding conventions

- Use `go fmt`. Keep handlers direct and feature-local.
- Follow existing Gin response, klog, and request-context patterns.
- For Kubernetes resources, use the existing registry, handlers, and clients;
  preserve cluster scope, namespace scope, and `_all` behavior.
- Do not bypass auth, cluster, RBAC, or AI tool authorization paths.
- Store sensitive persisted values with `model.SecretString`; never log secrets.
- For user-visible frontend text, use i18n keys and keep `en.json` and `zh.json`
  in sync.
